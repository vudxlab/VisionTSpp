## 🎉 What's New

* 🚩 **News** (Sep 2025): We release the Hugging Face Space [[VisionTSpp on Huggingface Space]](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Lefei/VisionTSpp) ! You can now quickly experience the forecasting capability of VisionTS++ directly in your browser! You can also upload your own custom time series CSV file for zero-shot forecasting!
* 🚩 **News** (Aug 2025): The inference code is now released! Please try [[demo.ipynb]](https://github.com/HALF111/VisionTSpp/blob/main/demo.ipynb) to run VisionTS++ on multivariate and probablistic time series forecasting.
* 🚩 **News** (Aug 2025): VisionTS++ (also called VisionTSpp) preprint has been made available on [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04379), as well as the training code and pre-trained models. Specifically, we provide the VisionTSpp-1.0-base model on [[Huggingface]](https://huggingface.co/Lefei/VisionTSpp), which we perform continual pre-traininig on [Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA data)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/lotsa_data/) based on [Masked AutoEncoder (MAE)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae) visual backbone.

## 🔍 About

+ In this work, we propose a new time series foundation model, VisionTS++, a SOTA time series foundation model by continual pre-training visual MAE on large-scale time series data, supporting multi-variate forecasting and probablistic forecasting!

<div align="center">
<img src="figures/teaser.png" style="width:80%;" />
</div>


+ Compared to [VisionTS](https://github.com/Keytoyze/VisionTS), VisionTS++ is equipped with three key innovations, including a `vision-model-based
filtering` mechanism that identifies high-quality time series data for pre-training, a `colorized multivariate conversion` method that transform multivariate time series into multi-subfigure RGB images, and a `multi-quantile forecasting` approach using parallel reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels.
+ Therefore, VisionTS++ **more effectively supports multivariate and probablistic time series forecasting**.

## 🚀 Quick Start & Inference

The VisionTS++ model is also uploaded to our package in PyPI. Please run the following command for installing **VisionTS++ and VisionTS**:

```shell
pip install visionts
```

If you want to develop the inference code, you can also build from source.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Keytoyze/VisionTS.git
cd VisionTS
pip install -e .
```

Then, you can refer to [[demo.ipynb]](https://github.com/HALF111/VisionTSpp/blob/main/demo.ipynb) on forecasting time series using **VisionTS++**, with clear visualizations of image reconstruction. 

In this demo, we show VisionTS++'s capability of effectively handling multivariate and probabilistic time series forecasting.


## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HALF111/VisionTSpp.git
cd VisionTSpp
```

2. Create virtual environment:

```shell
virtualenv venv --python=python3.10
. venv/bin/activate
```

3. Build from source:

```shell
pip install -e '.[notebook]'
```

4. Create a `.env` file:

```shell
touch .env
```

## 💻 Continual Pre-training

We also provide scripts for continual pre-training on Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA data) based on Masked AutoEncoder base (MAE-base) visual backbone. If you want to perform continual pre-training yourself, please run the following instructions.

1. You should start with preparing the data for pre-training first, by downloading the [Large-scale Open Time Series Archive (LOTSA data)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/lotsa_data/).
   Assuming you've already created a `.env` file, run the following commands.

```shell
huggingface-cli download Salesforce/lotsa_data --repo-type=dataset --local-dir PATH_TO_SAVE
echo "LOTSA_V1_PATH=PATH_TO_SAVE" >> .env
```

2. Afterwards, you should download MAE-base model from following links: [MAE-base](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/mae/visualize/mae_visualize_vit_base.pth). You can choose to download [MAE-large](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/mae/visualize/mae_visualize_vit_large.pth) or [MAE-huge](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/mae/visualize/mae_visualize_vit_huge.pth) as well. 

You should also write the path where you save the MAE models in the `.env` file, for example:

```shell
echo "VISIONTS_CHECKPOINT_PATH=./project/benchmarks/ckpt" >> .env
```

3. Finally, you can simply run the following script to start the continual pre-training (the same as in [run.sh](https://github.com/HALF111/VisionTSpp/blob/main/run.sh)). 

```shell
# base model
python -m cli.train -cp conf/pretrain run_name=VisionTSpp_base  model=visionts data=lotsa_v1_weighted
```

You can also try continual pre-training on MAE-large or MAE-huge:

```shell
# large model:
python -m cli.train -cp conf/pretrain run_name=VisionTSpp_large  model=visionts_large data=lotsa_v1_weighted

# huge model:
python -m cli.train -cp conf/pretrain run_name=VisionTSpp_huge  model=visionts_huge data=lotsa_v1_weighted
```

Additionally, if you want to modify some configurations during training, you can refer to the settings in [default.yaml](https://github.com/HALF111/VisionTSpp/blob/main/cli/conf/pretrain/default.yaml), [model/visionts.yaml](https://github.com/HALF111/VisionTSpp/blob/main/cli/conf/pretrain/model/visionts.yaml) and [data/lotsa_v1_weighted_image.yaml](https://github.com/HALF111/VisionTSpp/blob/main/cli/conf/pretrain/data/lotsa_v1_weighted_image.yaml).
